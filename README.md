INTRODUCTION
============

Yan's collection of scripts for daily chores. Use at your own risk!
There is no warranty. But I still welcome comments/issues/pull
requests.


TIPS
====

## Supported OS

[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) (usually the latest and latest-1
releases) is my work horse OS so most scripts here are tested on it. I
also use [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) (usually the stable and
testing branches) but not all scripts are tested on Debian.

## Naming Convention

Generally scripts that begin with _ are support scripts that will be
called by other scripts. You can ignore them unless you feel like
plumbing.
